Description: Functions for geostatistical modeling and kriging with
    gridded data, and spatially separable covariance functions (Kronecker
    covariances). Kronecker products in these models provide shortcuts for
    solving large matrix problems in likelihood and conditional mean,
    making snapKrig computationally efficient with large grids. The package
    supplies its own S3 grid object class, and a host of methods including
    plot, print, Ops, square bracket replace/assign, and more.
