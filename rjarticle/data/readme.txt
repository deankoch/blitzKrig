The data sub-directory should contain the following:

1) cv_experiment.R - executes cross-validation study

2) bench_experiment.R - executes benchmark study

3) bench_experiment_helpers.R - helpers for (2)

4) data_helpers.R - helpers for loading example data

5) cv_result.csv - summary of output from (1)

6) bench_result.csv - summary of output from (2)

7) treed.tif - example data written by (2)

8) treed_dem.tif - example data written by (2)

To regenerate the data files (5)-(8), run the two scripts (1) and (2) in any order.
The two tif files (7) and (8) will be downloaded and saved at the beginning of (2)
if they are not found in the expected location.

Note that (1) takes about 15 minutes to complete, and (2) takes about 6 hours. Both
overwrite their respective output csv files (5)-(6) with updated results.

Users running (2) should note that about 4gb of disk space is needed by the script.
Detailed output is by default written to the subdirectory "bench_output". See the
comments at the beginning of bench_experiment.R before running (2) script to check
that "bench_output" is a suitable path for this data.

Note also that results from (2) will vary depending on the hardware specifications
of the users' PC. The results reported in the paper (6) were generated by a 64bit
Windows 10 machine with an intel i7-4790K CPU and 32GB RAM.
